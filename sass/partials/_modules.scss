/* Sidebar Widget

 This is generic styling for any widgets that appear in any sidebar.
 Since this is for any widget, it should be very general (possibly defining a title bar, spacing with other widgets, etc). */

/* Horizontal Navigation Menu 

 A horizontal naviation menu, designed to (generally) appear at the top of a page, possibly above or below a header image. 
 It hooks into the code generated by the WordPress menu functionality, and will become a CSS-driven drop-down menu if required.
 (See [_dropdown.scss] for more information about the specific functionality of the drop-down menu) */
