WordPress Theme Template
========================

I've made this very, very simple WorPress theme as a
sort of template to work off of in the future. The
idea is that it will contain a number of the simple
things I need to implement in each WordPress project
so I won't have to keep doing them over and over.

That will include:

[A[B* Code for sidebar(s)
* Very flat layout of basic code (i.e., the Loop)
* A set of basic, standardized, classes, ids, etc
* Reset CSS along with very basic formatting
* Possibly code that can be used for things like
    dropdown menus, when needed
* Other stuff, as it comes to mind

If you found this, I'm not sure how, but you're
welcome to use it. If you're going to use it for
business or commercial stuff, I'd appreciate
